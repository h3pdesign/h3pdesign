👋 Hi, I’m **h3p**

I’m a technologist and photographer based in Germany, working primarily in **Python, data science, and native software development**. I’m interested in building focused, maintainable tools and sharing work openly.

### What I work on
- 📊 **Data science & Python** (analysis, tooling, experimentation)
- ☁️ **Cloud platforms**, currently focusing on **Microsoft Azure**
- 🧩 **Open-source software**, with an emphasis on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability
- 🖥️ Native macOS development and lightweight developer tools
- 📷 Photography and visual projects, often intersecting with technical workflows

### Open source & collaboration
Most of my projects are developed in the open and shared publicly. I value:
- small, well-scoped tools
- readable code and documentation
- constructive collaboration and long-term sustainability

I’m open to collaboration on projects connected to **https://h3p.me/apps**.

### Support
